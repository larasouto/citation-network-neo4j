1001,Compactification  Geometry and Duality: N=2,2000,,  These are notes based on lectures given at TASI99. We review the geometry ofthe moduli space of N=2 theories in four dimensions from the point of view ofsuperstring compactification. The cases of a type IIA or type IIB stringcompactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold and the heterotic string compactified onK3xT2 are each considered in detail. We pay specific attention to thedifferences between N=2 theories and N>2 theories. The moduli spaces of vectormultiplets and the moduli spaces of hypermultiplets are reviewed. In the caseof hypermultiplets this review is limited by the poor state of our currentunderstanding. Some peculiarities such as ``mixed instantons   and thenon-existence of a universal hypermultiplet are discussed.
1002,Domain Walls and Massive Gauged Supergravity Potentials,2000,Class.Quant.Grav.,  We point out that massive gauged supergravity potentials- for example thosearising due to the massive breathing mode of sphere reductions in M-theory orstring theory- allow for supersymmetric (static) domain wall solutions whichare a hybrid of a Randall-Sundrum domain wall on one side- and a dilatonicdomain wall with a run-away dilaton on the other side. On the anti-de Sitter(AdS) side- these walls have a repulsive gravity with an asymptotic regioncorresponding to the Cauchy horizon- while on the other side the runawaydilaton approaches the weak coupling regime and a non-singular attractivegravity- with the asymptotic region corresponding to the boundary of spacetime.We contrast these results with the situation for gauged supergravity potentialsfor massless scalar modes- whose supersymmetric AdS extrema are genericallymaxima- and there the asymptotic regime transverse to the wall corresponds tothe boundary of the AdS spacetime. We also comment on the possibility that themassive breathing mode may- in the case of fundamental domain-wall sources-stabilize such walls via a Goldberger-Wise mechanism.
1003,Comment on  Metric Fluctuations in Brane Worlds ,2000,,  Recently- Ivanov and Volovich (hep-th/9912242) claimed that the perturbationof $h_{\mu\nu}$ with nonvanishing transverse components $h_{5\mu}$ is notlocalized on the brane because $h_{\mu\nu}$ depends on the fifth coordinate $z$linearly. Consequently- it may indicate that the effective theory is unstable.However- we point out that such linear dependence on $z$ can be {\it gaugedaway}. Hence the solution does not belong to the physical one. Therefore- evenif one includes $h_{5\mu}$- Randall and Sundrum s argument for the localizedgravity on the brane remains correct.
1004,Moving Mirrors and Thermodynamic Paradoxes,2000,Phys.Rev.,  Quantum fields responding to  moving mirrors  have been predicted to giverise to thermodynamic paradoxes. I show that the assumption in such work thatthe mirror can be treated as an external field is invalid: the exoticenergy-transfer effects necessary to the paradoxes are well below the scales atwhich the model is credible. For a first-quantized point-particle mirror- itappears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in themirror s state. An accurate accounting of these energies will require a modelwhich recognizes the mirror s finite reflectivity- and almost certainly a modelwhich allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes- that is- asecond-quantized model.
1005,Bundles of chiral blocks and boundary conditions in CFT,2000,,  Various aspects of spaces of chiral blocks are discussed. In particular-conjectures about the dimensions of irreducible sub-bundles are reviewed andtheir relation to symmetry breaking conformal boundary conditions is outlined.
1006,Questions in quantum physics: a personal view,2000,,  An assessment of the present status of the theory- some immediate tasks whichare suggested thereby and some questions whose answers may require a longerbreath since they relate to significant changes in the conceptual andmathematical structure of the theory.
1007,Topological Defects in 3-d Euclidean Gravity,2000,,  By making use of the complete decomposition of SO(3) spin connection- thetopological defect in 3-dimensional Euclidean gravity is studied in detail. Thetopological structure of disclination is given as the combination of a monopolestructure and a vortex structure. Furthermore- the Kac-Moody algebra generatedby the monopole and vortex is discussed in three dimensional Chern-Simonstheory.
1008,N=0 Supersymmetry and the Non-Relativistic Monopole,2000,Phys.Lett.,  We study some of the algebraic properties of the non-relativistic monopole.We find that we can construct theories that possess an exotic conservedfermionic charge that squares to the Casimir of the rotation group- yet do notpossess an ordinary supersymmetry. This is in contrast to previous knownexamples with such exotic fermionic charges. We proceed to show that thepresence of the exotic fermionic charge in the non-supersymmetric theory cannonetheless be understood using supersymmetric techniques- providing yetanother example of the usefulness of supersymmetry in understandingnon-supersymmetric theories.
1009,Gluon Pair Production From Space-Time Dependent Chromofield,2000,,  We compute the probabilty for the processes A -> q \bar{q}- gg via vacuumpolarization in the presence of a classical space-time dependent non-abelianfield A by applying the background field method of QCD. The processes weconsider are leading order in gA and are simillar to A -> e^+e^- in QED. Gluonsare treated like a matter field and gauge transformations of the quantumgluonic field are different from those of the classical chromofield. To obtainthe correct physical polarization of gluons we deduct the corresponding ghostcontributions. We find that the expression for the probability of the leadingorder process A -> gg is transverse with respect to the momentum of the field.We observe that the contributions from higher order processes to gluon pairproduction need to be added to the this leading order process. Our resultpresented here is a part of the expression for the total probability for gluonpair production from a space-time dependent chromfield. The result for q
1010,Instantons  Euclidean supersymmetry and Wick rotations,2000,Phys.Lett.,  We discuss the reality properties of the fermionic collective coordinates inEuclidean space in an instanton background and construct hermitean actions forN = 4 and N = 2 supersymmetric Euclidean Yang-Mills theories.
1011,Noncommutativities of D-branes and $\theta$-changing Degrees of Freedom,2000,Phys.Lett.,  It is known that when there are several D-branes- their space-timecoordinates in general become noncommutative. From the point of view ofnoncommutative geometry- it reflects noncommutativity of the world volume ofthe D-branes. On the other hand- as we showed in the previous work- in thepresence of the constant antisymmetric tensor field the momentum operators ofthe D-branes have noncommutative structure. In the present paper- weinvestigate a relation between these noncommutativities and the description ofD-branes in terms of the noncommutative Yang-Mills theory recently proposed bySeiberg and Witten. It is shown that the noncommutativity of the Yang-Millstheory- which implies that of the world volume coordinates- originates fromboth noncommutativities of the transverse coordinates and momenta from theviewpoint of the lower-dimensional D-branes. Moreover- we show that thisnoncommutativity is transformed by coordinate transformations on the worldvolume and thereby can be chosen in an arbitrary fixed value. We also make abrief comment on a relation between this fact and a hidden symmetry of the IIBmatrix models.
1012,Boundary Liouville Field Theory I. Boundary State and Boundary Two-point,2000,,  Liouville conformal field theory is considered with conformal boundary. Thereis a family of conformal boundary conditions parameterized by the boundarycosmological constant- so that observables depend on the dimensional ratios ofboundary and bulk cosmological constants. The disk geometry is considered. Wepresent an explicit expression for the expectation value of a bulk operatorinside the disk and for the two-point function of boundary operators. Wecomment also on the properties of the degenrate boundary operators. Possibleapplications and further developments are discussed. In particular- we presentexact expectation values of the boundary operators in the boundary sin-Gordonmodel.
1013,Gravity and the Newtonian limit in the Randall-Sundrum model,2000,Phys.Lett.,  We point out that the gravitational evolution equations in theRandall-Sundrum model appear in a different form than hitherto assumed. As aconsequence- the model yields a correct Newtonian limit in a novel manner.
1014,Gauge theories in local causal perturbation theory,2000,,  In this thesis quantum gauge theories are considered in the framework oflocal- causal perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is described in terms ofthe BRS formalism. Local interacting field operators are constructedperturbatively and field equations are established. A nilpotent BRStransformation is defined on the local algebra of fields. It allows thedefinition of the algebra of local observables as an operator cohomology. Thisalgebra of local observables can be represented in a Hilbert space.  The interacting field operators are defined in terms of time ordered productsof free field operators. For the results above to hold the time orderedproducts must satisfy certain normalization conditions. To formulate theseconditions also for field operators that contain a spacetime derivative asuitable mathematical description of time ordered products is developed.  Among the normalization conditions are Ward identities for the ghost currentand the BRS current. The latter are generalizations of a normalizationcondition that is postulated by D utsch- Hurth- Krahe and Scharf for Yang-Millstheory. It is not yet proven that this condition has a solution in every order.All other normalization conditions can be accomplished simultaneously.  A principle for the correspondence between interacting quantum fields andinteracting classical fields is established. Quantum electrodynamics andYang-Mills theory are examined and the results are compared with theliterature.
1015,Canonical Quantization and Topological Theories,2000,Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl.,  The canonical quantization of the topological particle is described; it isshown that BRST quantization of the model gives the supersymmetric quantummechanical model considered by Witten when investigating Morse theory- and therigorous path integral method appropriate for this model is discussed.Possibilities for the extension of this work to two dimensional models arebriefly considered.
1016,A Comment on the Holographic Renormalization Group and the Soft Dilaton,2000,Phys.Lett.,  The equivalence between the holographic renormalization group and the softdilaton theorem is shown for a class of wrapped metrics solutions of the stringbeta function equations for the bosonic string.
1017,The Interaction of Two Hopf Solitons,2000,Phys.Lett.,  This Letter deals with topological solitons in an O(3) sigma model in threespace dimensions (with a Skyrme term to stabilize their size). The solitons areclassified topologically by their Hopf number N. The N=2 sector is studied; inparticular- for two solitons far apart- there are three ``attractivechannels  . Viewing the solitons as dipole pairs enables one to predict theforce between them. Relaxing in the attractive channels leads to various static2-soliton solutions.
1018,Solitons in Brane Worlds II,2000,Nucl.Phys.,  We study the solution describing a non-extreme dilatonic (p+1)-braneintersecting a D-dimensional extreme dilatonic domain wall- where one of itslongitudinal directions is along the direction transverse to the domain wall-in relation to the Randall-Sundrum type model. The dynamics of the probe(p+1)-brane in such source background reproduces that of the probe p-brane inthe background of the (D-1)-dimensional source p-brane. However- as for a probetest particle- the dynamics in one lower dimensions is reproduced- only whenthe source (p+1)-brane is uncharged.
1019,Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball with uniform velocity of,2000,Phys.Rev.,  The Casimir energy- free energy and Casimir force are evaluated- at arbitraryfinite temperature- for a dilute dielectric ball with uniform velocity of lightinside the ball and in the surrounding medium. In particular- we investigatethe classical limit at high temperature. The Casimir force found is repulsive-as in previous calculations.
1020,Some uses of moduli spaces in particle and field theory,2000,,  In this talk I shall try to give an elementary introduction to certain areasof mathematical physics where the idea of moduli space is used to help solveproblems or to further our understanding. In the wide area of gauge theory- Ishall mention instantons- monopoles and duality. Then- under the generalheading of string theory- I shall indicate briefly the use of moduli space inconformal field theory and $M$-theory.
